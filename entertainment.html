			<h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
				<p>VR and Augmented Reality allows gadgets like mobile phones, headsets, smart glasses, and connected devices to add digital overlays to live views. The low latency and high bandwidth of 5G makes these devices more desirable for entertainment.</p>
			<h3>Media</h3>
				<p>In today's ever-evolving digital world, 5G technology is revolutionizing the way we consume media and content. This has huge implications for the media and entertainment industry, with faster speeds, more efficient use of bandwidth, and new ways to interact with content. 5G will enable media companies to deliver higher-quality content to their audiences, creating enhanced engagement and opportunities for live events, such as streaming concerts and sports events to global audiences.
Entertainment companies are embracing 5G advancements, forming partnerships with network providers, manufacturers, and software developers to tap into new revenue streams. Enhanced mobile networks in crowded, large-scale venues can help create the perfect atmosphere by enabling attendees to communicate with one another online, access exclusive content and commentary, and purchase merchandise on the spot. Faster computer response times will enable cloud computing solutions, allowing gamers to play without interruption with multiple people on several mobile devices - features that are usually only available on gaming consoles and powerful PCs. Virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) are also gaining traction, offering users a more interactive and immersive experience.
Businesses can look forward to AR and VR integration, as well as hyper-personalized audience targeting. With detailed targeting data, marketers can deliver multi-channel messaging that advertises products and services at a precise point of need, while algorithms can inform predictive technology. 5G has the potential to bring about huge shifts across multiple industries, such as advertising, sports and journalism, with its limitless possibilities.

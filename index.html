        		<h1>WHAT IS DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION?</h1>
				<p>Disruptive Innovation is a process wherein the current status quo of business is challenged by a smaller company. This happens when mainstream companies neglect some of their products and focus on improving high demand and highly profitable items. A smaller company might then use this opportunity to produce quality of those neglected products, selling them under market value, In addition to this, they proceed to take on the role of producing for the mainstream company's mainstream clients. The moment those clients purchase in high amounts, disruption has occurred. A few things to note, disruptive innovations ONLY happen when mainstream companies overlook a certain market or when disrupters make an entirely new market. It must increase quality before clients take notice since clients won't be willing to switch immediately. It is a process and Disrupters often have different business models nor do they always succeed. They do, however, enable a new market and value network to enter the field and eventually disrupt the existing ones. THey also unexpectedly improve a product or service.</p>

			<h3>Smart Cities</h3>
				<p>Smart Cities make use of IoT devices to collect its data whether it be from traffic, people, or infrastructures. 5G enables them to do this in real time. Analyzing this data is vital for the city to make informed decisions regarding things that concerns it such as public services, traffic, and air quality. 5G could also possibly connect cities together in ways we can yet see.</p>

    			<h3>Healthcare</h3>
				<p>The speed of 5G is vital to healthcare and might even save a life. There are technology that are wearables that gather data from you such as your heartrate; this data can be transferred to a healthcare professional in the case of an emergency. More than that, remote surgery is now possible and more commonplace.</p>

    			<h3>Environment</h3>
				<p>5G uses low power compared to its predecessors. The advancements that it will build will help us focus our attention more to green things which would therefore improve the quality of air, water, and other environmental indicators. Investing in things like smart building, smart grid projects, remote work, electric vehicles, all of these will contribute to environmental change.</p>

    			<h3>Education and Learning</h3>
				<p>Over the years, technology has paved the way in terms of education and the academic field. As relevant as it is today, 5G technology has shown its significance in the area as it has become a powerful tool to enhance the learning structure in the advancement of technology. 5G has been helpful to students and made education more convenient and accessible, easier to find resources on the net, and provided the academic community an opportunity to persist even during the pandemic era. A lot of advantages have been present concerning 5G technology however, as beneficial as it is, it will always have at least one mishap with its overall performance. With 5G Technology, a wider range of sources and networks can be reached through the internet, in those cases, there are underlying disruptions that can occur. From the information that comes from different sources, students can be misled with unreliable data and inaccurate information. Another setback here includes a more advanced set of skills which requires the learner to train to catch up with the structure of the system. Here also lies the gap that is present between developing countries and advanced nations in terms of technology. Given that matter, 5G Technology has a higher possibility of disruption to countries that are not well-developed in their technological aspect. This can be a threat to the community since not everyone is privileged to educational opportunities such as this. As an example, those students in most rural areas do not have connectivity which leads back to the digital divide issue. Considering that technology has not progressed enough in one country, 5G technology will be a threat to learners. On the other hand, a distinct disadvantage of this innovation is the excessive dependence of a student on the Internet. It can be a huge possibility if a learner does not know how to use the internet wisely, without knowing its limitations. Evidently, there are more disadvantages of 5G Technology in education but it all leads back to the main point which is technology remains a tool to enhance learning not the other way around.
